# Arcade-Game Project: 'Frogger'

## How to run the game
### Using ```npm```:
```javascript
$ npm install --global live-server
$ live-server
```

## How to play the game
The game obeys the same rules as the classic Frogger game, it implements a basic functionality;
when the player wins (reaches the water) its position is reset.
