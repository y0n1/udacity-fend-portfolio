You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* I've learned about how to layout better the page into paragraphs, now I better understand what kind of content should be in <p> tags and what not.
* Well overall this part has been a refresher for me. Every single part was easy and enjoyful (so far).
* Nothing in special was difficult so far.
* In case there is something I didn't remember how to do or dind't know how to do I used StackOverflow to find answers to my question or MDN to research.
